					<li> I love to play Football since my childhood. My favourite club is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=manchester+United&oq=manchester+United&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.3692j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Manchester United</a> and I have been a loyal fan ever since.</li></p>
					<p>
					<li> Apart from being interested in football, I am also a fitness fiend and regular member of the gym. These characteristics develop inside me a deep rooted sense of accomplishment at the start of the day and also help me live a comparatively healthy lifestyle if looked at it from a long term telescope.</li></p>
					<p>
					<li>
						I also like to watch Webseries and TV shows. Few of them being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">Friends</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">Big Bang Theory</a>. I am also into Japanese Animated Films also known as 'Anime'.
						Most popular Anime are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note">Deathnote.</a>

					<p>
					<li> I have developed an interest within me for coding and computer programming and my natural curosity almost enhances my willingness to learn more about the subject as I look towards it as a career and arena i would much like to keep alongside me in the forseeble future.</li></p>
					<p>
					<li>
						I am also interested in learning more about front-end and back-end development and have the interest in entering into its depths.
						Hence, I have started to learn about Web Development and trying to implement my skills in making this website.
